This project contains a machine learning approach to analyze the Diabetes dataset, aiming to predict diabetes occurrence based on various health metrics. Two machine learning models are used for this purpose: the Decision Tree Classifier and Logistic Regression. The Decision Tree Classifier is chosen for its interpretability, allowing us to understand the decision-making process, while Logistic Regression is applied due to its effectiveness in binary classification tasks. The goal of the project is to compare the performance of these models, assess their accuracy, and identify which model best predicts diabetes status within the dataset.
